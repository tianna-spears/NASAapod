This is a project from the Zero To Hero React.JS Full Course (Project 2 of 4). This project is to build a React Application using an API from NASA to display the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).

The purpose of building this application is to sharpen skills in React components by practicing using props as well as defining, rendering, and referencing components.

Thank you for your support! Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
